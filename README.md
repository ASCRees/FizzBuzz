Fizz Buzz Test
--------------

Code refactored to remove the use of any If statements.

----------------------------------------------

This solution includes an example of the Fizz Buzz test, but it has been extended to include more than just Fizz and Buzz.

An html page will prompt the user to enter a number. The javascript library will then loop through the number 1 to the entered value and if the number is divisible by 3 output Fizz, if its divisible by 5 output Buzz, if its divisible by 4 output Top, if its divisible by 6 output Frost. This can be extended by altering the array in defineFizzBuzzParams.

The code includes Jasmine testing of the library functions. 
The Jasmine tests can be run from the test explorer in Visual Studio. 

This uses the Chutzpah framework to enable them to be visible. Note Chutzpah does not work with ES6.
